# ForestFireModelling
My final project for the computing aspect of my degree.

This report investigates a parallelised forest fire simulation, based on cellular automata principles and implemented using MPI (Message Passing Interface). The primary aims of the project are to simulate fire spread through a discretised forest grid, assess the impact of parallelisation on computational performance and evaluate model convergence, with respect to the number of runs M and tree density probability p.
The simulation models a forest as a two-dimensional grid, where each cell may be empty, contain a tree, or represent a burning tree. Fire spreads through the grid following cellular automata rules based on the Von Neumann neighbourhood. The model accommodates random grid generation via probabilistic tree placement, as well as user-defined or file-based input. Simulation outcomes include fire duration, whether the fire reaches the bottom row, and execution time across varying grid sizes and parallelisation levels.
